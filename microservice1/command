In distributed tracing the data volumes can be very high so sampling can be important.This determines what amount of data you want to send to a centralized log analysis tool. If you want to send all the data or only a part of it. If you are exporting span data to Zipkin or Spring Cloud Stream, there is also an AlwaysSampler that exports everything and a PercentageBasedSampler that samples a fixed fraction of spans. We will be making use of the Always Sampler for this example.
